title: BDD & Gherkin

---

TestQuality supports most of the standard [Gherkin](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/reference/) keywords used to write clear, structured test cases. This allows QA teams to define scenarios in a natural language format while maintaining consistent test structure.

## Supported Keywords

Below is a list of supported keywords, how they are typically used, and how each is mapped within the TestQuality interface.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** `Rule` is not supported yet.  
> üñçÔ∏è **Syntax highlighting** is planned ‚Äî track progress on our [public roadmap](https://testquality.productlift.dev/p/support-for-gherkin-syntax-highlighting-for-your-manual-test-H2Yue2).

## Manual + Automation with Gherkin

TestQuality bridges the gap between manual and automated testing by making **Gherkin** the shared language of your QA team. Whether you‚Äôre manually designing test cases or importing results from automation tools like **Cucumber**, **Behave**, **SpecFlow**, or **Gauge**, TestQuality provides a unified platform to manage, track, and scale your quality process.

### Importing `.feature` Files for Manual Test Cases

You can import Gherkin-based `.feature` files to quickly create structured test cases inside TestQuality.

**Step 1: Open the Import Dialog**  
Go to the **Test Cases** module ‚Üí click **Import BDD Feature File**.

![Import Gherkin Feature File](../img/Import_BDD_featurefile.png)

**Step 2: Upload the Gherkin `.feature` File**  
Drag and drop your Gherkin file into the dialog box or click to browse and select it from your computer. You can also assign the test cases to a root folder and cycle during this step.

![Gherkin Test Cases](../img/Gherkin_test_cases.png)

- Each `Feature` will be turned into a folder
- Each `Scenario` or `Scenario Outline` will become a test case
- Gherkin tags, tables, backgrounds, and doc strings are preserved
- Ideal for teams adopting BDD manually or starting test design with natural language syntax

---

### Importing `.json` Files for Automation Results

You can upload Cucumber-compatible JSON files after executing your automated tests using either of the following two options:

Go to the **Automations** module ‚Üí click **Import Cucumber File (JSON)**.

![Import Cucumber JSON File](../img/Automations_CucumberJson.png)
---

#### Option 1: Upload via UI

![Upload via UI](../img/JSON_UI_upload.png)

- Drag and drop your result file
- Associate it with a test cycle
- Execution results will be tracked, reported, and linked

---

#### Option 2: Upload via CLI (Recommended for CI/CD)

Use the TestQuality CLI to upload results automatically as part of your pipeline.

### Works with Your Favorite BDD Tools

TestQuality supports seamless integration with test automation frameworks that use Gherkin syntax, including:

- **Cucumber** (Java, Ruby, JavaScript)
- **Behave** (Python)
- **SpecFlow** (.NET)
- **Gauge**
- **Lettuce**
- And other tools that output `.feature` files or Cucumber-style `.json` results
