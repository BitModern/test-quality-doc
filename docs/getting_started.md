### Creating your first project

When you first open TestQuality, you'll be prompted to create your initial project. Assuming you've completed this step, let's dive right into your next operation.

### Creating a test

To create a test, you can either watch the [create a test](https://youtu.be/HpgHJrP8gow) video or follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the "Tests" tab at the top of the page.

2. Choose to either:
   - Click 'Create Test Case' in the middle of the page (for new tests).
   - Use the "New Test" button in the top-right corner.

3. Provide a name, add a test step (e.g., "Login"), and specify the expected result.

### Creating a cycle

A cycle is a group of tests that you want to run together multiple times, such as before releasing a new version of your application. 

To create a cycle, you can either watch the [create a cycle](https://youtu.be/pIBrfyhPVKw) video or follow these steps:

1. A cycle can contain one or more tests. Use the test selector to choose tests for your cycle.
2. Click 'Add to Cycle' in the menu at the bottom of the page.

4. Press Enter or click "Create" to confirm.

### Executing your tests

To execute a test, you can either watch the [execute a test](https://youtu.be/d-dObYB2i8s) video or follow these steps:

#### Creating a test run

Before you can execute your tests, it's essential to set up a test run. Follow these steps:

1. Start by selecting the tests you want to include from the 'Tests' tab.

2. In the menu that appears at the bottom of the page, click "Run."

3. In the run dialogue, click "Create." At this stage, there's no need to specify a Cycle or a Milestone.

Now, let's move on to executing your tests:

1. Click the "Test Runs" tab.

2. To access and execute your specific test, click on the pending test. This action will open the test drawer.

3. Here, you can enter the actual result and assign a status to complete the execution process.

### Analyzing the test results

In the 'Insights' tab, you can access real-time reports on the growth, quality, reliability, and coverage of the tests you have executed.
