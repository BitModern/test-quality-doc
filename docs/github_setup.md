GitHub serves as a central hub for developers, offering version control, collaboration tools, and project management features. Integrating TestQuality with GitHub brings together the power of test case creation, defect management, and test coverage analysis within your GitHub environment.

## Leveraging Two-Way Integration

The core advantage of TestQuality's integration with GitHub lies in its live two-way synchronization. This means that changes made in either platform, whether it's updating defect priorities or adding new test cases, are reflected instantly across both TestQuality and GitHub. This real-time synchronization ensures that your teams and tools are always in sync, leading to enhanced productivity and collaboration.

### Integrating GitHub on TestQuality

To integrate GitHub with TestQuality, follow these steps:

**Step 1:** Begin by adding an integration from the 'Create New Project' -> 'Project Details' screen or via the Profile menu -> Integrations. Make sure you have admin privileges for the GitHub repository you're connecting to.

- Navigate to the Integrations screen and locate the GitHub section.
- Click on "Link on GitHub."

**Step 2:** Authorize Access: During installation, you may be prompted to authorize TestQuality to access your GitHub repositories and organizations. Follow the on-screen instructions to grant the necessary permissions. You will be navigated back to TestQuality after authorization.

**Step 3:** Click on 'Add Project' to link an existing project to the GitHub integration. Select the project, organization, and repository, and then click on 'Create.'

You have the flexibility to link the same project to multiple GitHub repositories and vice versa.

After completing these steps, GitHub will be integrated with TestQuality, allowing for seamless interaction between the two platforms. Once integrated, you can now add stories and log defects from TestQuality.

**Configuration at the Global Level:**

You can also configure your integration at the global level by accessing the gear icon.

- Manage default tags
- Edit integration templates for creating new stories and bugs
- Disassociate the integration
- Delete the integration

**Note:** Proceed with caution when deleting an integration. It will remove all defect and story integrations from TestQuality but not from GitHub.
