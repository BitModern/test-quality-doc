## Test Growth




### Filtering the graph.

When viewing by Milestone, the data for your Milestone is displayed on the graph and Test Totals display to the left of teh graph.

When selecting by Milestone, if your Milestone does not have a start and end date you will be prompted to enter dates. 

*Note: The filter by Milestone for Test Growth works differently than filterng by Milestone on the [Overview](Overview) page. This is because the Overview page graph is listing Runs and Tests that are linked to a Milestone regardless of dates, whereas this Test Growth graph is a display of changes over a time period.*
