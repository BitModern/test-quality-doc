3. Provide a name, add a test step (e.g., "Login"), and specify the expected result.

## Creating a Cycle

A cycle is a group of tests that you want to run together multiple times, such as before releasing a new version of your application. 

To create a test cycle, follow these steps:

1. A cycle can contain one or more tests. Use the test selector to choose tests for your cycle.
2. Click 'Add to Cycle' in the menu at the bottom of the page.

4. Press Enter or click "Create" to confirm.

## Executing Your Tests

### Creating a Test Run

Before you can execute your tests, it's essential to set up a test run. Follow these steps:

1. Start by selecting the tests you want to include from the 'Tests' tab.

2. In the menu that appears at the bottom of the page, click "Run."

3. In the run dialogue, click "Create." At this stage, there's no need to specify a Cycle or a Milestone.

Now, let's move on to executing your tests:

1. Click the "Test Runs" tab.

2. To access and execute your specific test, click on the pending test. This action will open the test drawer.
