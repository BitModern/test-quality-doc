# Changing your Lookup Data

On the Lookup Data page you can customize different items within your site that classify your tests. When filtering your test views, the Lookup Data fields allow you to view your tests with different use cases in mind. Perhaps you would like to list by priority, so you can ensure your most important tests are executed first. Maybe your UI tests are vital to your Milestone, tailoring your Lookup Data ensures your testing efforts are efficient, and your team is effective. 

## Status 
When a test is in 'executable mode' the status can be changed to represent the result of executing the test. Pass, Pending, Fail, Block, Retest, or skip are all the default status types. Should you wish to add a different status, you can add a custom status to match your use case. 
## Purpose
You can mark a test with the reason for testing, such as UI, Unit, Installation, Acceptance, Regression, System, Smoke, Sanity, Integration, Component Interface Test, are the default types. Should you wish to add your own, you can add a custom test purpose. 
## Case Type
There are 8 standard test case types Accessibility, Compatibility, Destuctive, Funcionality Performance, Security, Usability, Internationalisation. Should you wish to include another case type to match your use case, custom types can be added in this screen.
## Case Priority
Add a priority to your test cases gives your testers an idea of which are the most important tests. The default priorities are from Lowest, Low, Medium, High to Highest, however if you would like to include your own priorities, you can add custom priorties here.
## Label
Labels can be added by typing in the label field in a test, or by adding the in the Lookup Data page. In the Lookup Data page you can also edit labels.
