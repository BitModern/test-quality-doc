## Overview

### Precondition
A Markdown based free text field that you can add anything that needs to be in place, or done before the test steps are carried out.

### Steps
Steps are the procedure that your tester will follow to complete the test execution. Each time you add a step, it is necessary to save the changes.

Expected Result - When you add text to the Expected Result field, it will become visible when you close the edit. Leaving the field empty will keep the field hidden. The expected result can be added to any step, which you may wish to use to help your tester ensure each step is successful. Or you may wish to only use an Expected Result on the final step, so the tester can know what the test result should be overall.

### Case Type
Depending on your type of test you can set a Case Type to define if your test is for example a Functionality, Performance, Security, Usability, Accessibility, Compatibility, Destructive etc. You can also set your own Case Type in the [Lookup Data](Administration/Lookup_Data) section.  
### Case Priority
Test Priority is a way to prioritise and schedule your test cases. You can modify the priority options in the [Lookup Data](Administration/Lookup_Data) section. By default, TestQuality comes with the following priority modes: Lowest, Low, Medium, High, Highest. This can help you plan your testing schedules, and also help you view your testing efforts by  [filtering](Filtering) those tests that you consider a higher priority. 
### Assigned to
Assigning a test to a user in your organisation will help you identify the tests that are handled by different members of your team, but also when a [Run](Run) is made that includes the assigned test, the Test in executable mode will be added to the assigned user's [ToDo list](ToDo_List).
