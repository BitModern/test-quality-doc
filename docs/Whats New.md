## Previous Releases
### Major Release - Summer 2021
### New Features
- **New UI**.


We are very pleased to announce a simpler, yet more capable interface to your Test Management. The new look TestQuality brings you simplicity in test authoring, easy organisation of your tests, a faster way of monitoring your project, and flexibility to match your workflow.
	
*The same but different...*

**A new structure** -  You may be familiar with our old framework of Project, Plan, Suite, (Sub Suite), Test Case, however because your test cases are very often the focus of your test management, it makes sense that the interface has a similar focus. In our new interface you have a dedicated tab for your tests, which you can organise into folders (and sub folders) and that's it. We have reduced the requirements for the full tree structure, so you can focus on what is important to you.

The user interface is now arranged into 4 tabs to group the functions that are often used together, but divided into common test management tasks. 
	
	
 - **Overview** - An easy glance at the overall status of your project, your 'quick check' page. View by milestone or date range. This is how you can quickly identify any issues before they become a problem. 
 - **Authoring Tests and Cycles** - A fresh way to create and edit your tests. Organise them in folders and choose the sequence that you want your tests to be run. Your tests are the backbone of your testing efforts, we wanted to give you an effective way of managing your tests in focus that they deserve. 
 
 Cycles are the tests that you want to run over and over again, perhaps you want to specify a particular environment or a particular tester, Cycles are part of your test plan and are used to achieve a particular testing goal.  
 - **Running your Tests and Cycles** - You now have a dedicated page to view your test runs. The Run page is where you can monitor your runs and do quick analysis on your test runs. Easy view of the tests in each test run, your test statuses and bug monitoring.
 - **Analysing your test results** - The analysis page is a more indepth study of your tests and runs. How many tests have been added, which tests are working great, and which tests might need some attention. 

**Light/Dark mode** - Dark mode, because... well, just because. Apparently some people really like turning off the lights and working in the dark, so we wanted to join the party and give you the best looking dark mode you have ever seen. It's ðŸ”¥!
