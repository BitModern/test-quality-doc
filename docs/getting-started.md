## What is TestQuality?

TestQuality is a test management application that enables you to easily monitor your testing efforts.

There are many different reasons for running tests. you could be a software company that is producing an application and you have tests that check the effects of changes that your developers make to the code as they fix bugs and add features. You could be a mining company that tests drilling core samples and you want to monitor your lab tests.

At TestQuality we know that the backbone of your testing, is your tests. So we have built an interface to match your priorities, with tests at the core of operations, but enabling the surrounding tasks to ensure success, once your tests are in place.

The interface is divided in to 4 main areas that are designed to be used at a single click. So as your focus on a set of tasks is in a single pane for each of your test management tasks.

## The basics

TestQuality is a test management solution that natively integrates with GitHub and Jira for defects and requirements and many other CI solutions using XML or Gherkin integration. Author tests, create milestones, test runs, and group common tests into cycles. The metrics and reports give you instant understanding of  your test results over time.
