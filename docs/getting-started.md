## What is TestQuality?

TestQuality is a test management solution that natively integrates with GitHub and Jira for defects and requirements and many other CI solutions using XML or Gherkin integration. 

With TestQuality you can author tests, create test runs, and group common tests into cycles. Set these against your own milestones to monitor your progress. The metrics and reports give you instant understanding of your test results over time.

TestQuality is a test management application that enables you to easily monitor your testing efforts.

At TestQuality we understand that your tests, are the backbone of your testing. So we have built an interface to match your priorities, with tests at the core of operations, but enabling the surrounding tasks to ensure success, once your tests are in place.

The interface is divided into 5 main areas that are easily navigated to at any time with a single click. Meaning that each set of your test management tasks has a single pane for each.
## 5 task screens:
### [Overview](Overview.md)
Your daily check-up. Edit and check your Milestones, view your test run results, and monitor logged defects/bugs over time.

<div class="img-with-text">

    <p>This view is great for your daily check-in.</p> 
</div>


### [Tests](Tests.md)
This is the best location to author and organise your tests. You have visibility for all tests, and can organise and manage a single test, or edit multiple tests at once with ease. 

For each test you can add steps and expected results, link to requirements, group in folders and more.
* The 'Command' feature gives you extreme power over your tests.

### [Run](Run.md)
Add a single test, or multiple tests and folders to a run. A test run is your test in 'execute' mode. Where you create a branch of your tests to check against a system in test.
View each run's overview, the results. and any logged defects.

### [Cycles](Cycles.md)

If you have tests that are often grouped together, for a task that you would run on a regular basis, creating a Cycle gives you the flexibility to ensure that the same tests are made every time. 

In the Cycles screen you have the same easy-to-use tabs that you will see in the Runs screen, the Overview, Test List, and Runs & Defects, giving you a easy management of your test Cycles.

From here you can also send a Cycle to a Run, generating a new test Run, from your chosen Cycle.
