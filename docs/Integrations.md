## Continuous Integration

If you are using a CI platform such as Jenkins, Cloudbees, Circle CI, Travis CI and want to upload your test results, you can add TestQuality to your scripts.

To connect via command line, you can use the command files from http://cli.testquality.com/ then using the file from your system, log in with username and password, or we can provide you with a personal access token so you do not have to provide your login details in the command.

### Personal Access Token
In the Integrations section of the settings menu you can create yourself a token.

Click on your username in the top right of any page.

Choose Integrations ![img_3.png](img_3.png)

The Integrations section will open within the settings menu.

On the right of the main window, you can choose to add a new Personal Access Token from the menu.

Click on the '+' sign in the Personal Access Token section.

Choose a name for your token. Click 'Create'.

To get information on your projects and plans is really easy using the command line. 

For example, to get a list of Projects in your TestQuality site, you can use the following command:

`testquality-macos projects`

This will list your projects with their ID, Key and Name. ![img.png](img.png)

Then you might want to list the Test Plans that are in your project, you can use the following command where you add the ID number of the project in the command (shown here as XXX):

`testquality-macos plans --project_id=XXX`

To use a Personal Access Token, you can add it right in to the command. 

`testquality-macos plans --project_id=XXX -at="ey78x2y39229d3998....... (really long token code)!`
