The Overview page is where you can get an instant understanding of how things are going for your project.

Select any of your projects using the Project Selector in the top left. Whenever you log in to TestQuality, you will see the last project that you had open.

## Milestones

Your Milestones are listed in the top pane, and the graph shows you the results from your Test Runs in that milestone. The view is dependent on the date range that you select in the top right of the graph.

The graph is colour coded, so you can see what number of tests passed and what failed etc.

## Run History

The Runs table shows you all the runs that have happened in the timeframe you have selected. That is either the dates of your currently selected Milestone, or the dates that you have selected in the date selector above the graph.  <img src="\img\Screens\date_selector.png" alt="date selector image" width="300" />


## Defects

The Defects table shows what defects or bugs have been registered in the time period of the selected date range.
Your defects are linked to GitHub or Jira.
