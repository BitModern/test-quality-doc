The Overview page is where you can instantly get a general understanding of how things are going for your project.

You can select a different project in the Project Selector in the top left. Whenever you arrive in TestQuality, the last project that you had open, is the project that will be open when you log back in.


## Milestones

Your Milestones are listed in the top pane, and the graph shows you the results from your Test Runs in that milestone. The view is dependant on the date range that you select in the top right of the graph.

The graph is colour coded so you can see what number of tests passed and what failed etc.

## Cycle Run History

This table is the results of your Cycle Runs.

Defects

The Defects table shows what defects or bugs have been registered in the time period of the selected date range.
Your defects are linked to GitHub or Jira.
