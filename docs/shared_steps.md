Shared Steps in TestQuality enable you to maintain a consistent testing approach by facilitating the reuse of steps across multiple test cases, thereby reducing redundancy and effort in test case management. 

You can easily create a Shared Step from an existing step or utilize them to construct or update test cases. Here's how:

## Creating a Shared Step

### From an Existing Step

- **In Edit/Create Test Case**: Click the **Convert into Shared Step** icon next to the desired step to share it.

*Create Test Case screen*

- **Selection and Reordering**: Select the steps you wish to add. If necessary, reorder the selected steps before adding them by dragging the **drag icon** next to each step.
- **Add to Test Case**: Once you've chosen and ordered your steps, click **Add** to include them in your test case.


**Shared Step Auto-Detection**

This feature automatically identifies existing shared steps when creating new steps and helps users avoid redundancy by promoting the reuse of shared steps.

## Modifying Shared Steps

### Updates and Deletions

- **Update**: Modify the shared step in any test case and save. Changes apply to all test cases using this Shared Step.
- **Delete**: Removing a Shared Step deletes it from all referenced test cases. Use caution.

Shared Steps streamline testing processes, making them more efficient and consistent. This guide enables you to fully leverage Shared Steps, enhancing productivity and testing quality.
