## Cycles
Cycles are collections of tests and folders that you want to run over and over again, perhaps you want to specify a particular environment or a particular tester, Cycles are part of your test plan and are used to achieve a particular testing goal.

## All Tests
A list of all your tests. Great for searching, organising and managing.
Create folders and sub-folders to arrange your tests in to logical sequences.

## [The Test Drawer](Test Drawer.md)
When you select a test in the test list you will open the sliding Test Drawer.
The test drawer has 3 tabs that give further information about the test.
