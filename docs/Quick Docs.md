### Don't have time to read the docs?

Here's the basics: With TestQuality you can manage your testing. Author tests, create milestones, create test runs, and group the tests into cycles. From there you can add your automated test results via an integration and manage and analyse your test results over time.

Let's get you up and running:

## Overview 
Create milestones, view your test run results, and number of logged defects/bugs over time.
- This view is great for your daily check in.

## Tests 
Your tests. This is the best place to author and organise your tests. Add steps and expected results, see what requirements they are linked to, group them in folders and more.
- The 'Command' feature gives you extreme power over your tests.
