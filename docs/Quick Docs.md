### Don't have time to read the docs?

Here's the basics: TestQuality is a test management solution that natively integrates with GitHub and Jira for defects and requirements and many other CI solutions using XML or Gherkin integration. Author tests, create milestones, test runs, and group common tests into cycles. The metrics and reports give you instant understanding of  your test results over time.


### The screens:
## Overview 
Edit and check your Milestones, view your test run results, and monitor logged defects/bugs over time.
This view is great for your daily check-in.

    <p>This view is great for your daily check-in.</p> 
</div>


## Tests 
Your tests. This is the best place to author and organise your tests. Add steps and expected results,link to requirements, group them in folders and more.
- The 'Command' feature gives you extreme power over your tests.
