Use Stories to track your features or requirements. 

Link tests that relate to your feature and are part of your story. Align your team on what is being tested and why, describe the story in the description. Use Labels, Priority, Status and Assignee to define and track your story.

To create a story you can link to an existing issue/requirement from your integrated repository, or create a new one.

When you add a new story, you will be prompted to include additional details such as a description or priority.

The story can be updated and tracked from TestQuality. If you would like to open the requirement/issue in your linked repository, you can click the button on the Story page to take you directly to GitHub or Jira.

## Tracking your tests

As your story grows and evolves, the number of tests will change. To track the progress of your story, view the changes in tests in the  [Analyze](/analyze)  tab.
